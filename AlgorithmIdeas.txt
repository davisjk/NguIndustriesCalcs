# Observations
When checking by square subsets, starting from the center is usually better.
Checking by rows + columns + diagonals can yield the best possible layout, but the order lines have to be checked in is not consistent between layouts.
Might need to keep track of layouts that match the best/current best and iterate on all of those.

# Ideas
## All Subsets :/ (better if starting in the center, but still not perfect) (probably best so far)
-only do this with knights-
split into subsets of every space that could be affected by a given space for each space
this might go faster if this was split up into two subsets, one for boxes and one for knights
pros:
seems to work for most boxes + knights
cons:
didn't work for 5x6, needs investigation
order that sets are checked in matters

## Middle/Big Subsets :(
only do this for boxes only
start with all subsets
remove supersets and subsets of sets that are both subsets and supersets
then remove any remaining subsets of supersets
pros:
seems to fix "all subsets" bug with -bpx for at least 3x5
cons:
needs more testing with other layouts that weren't working for "all subsets"
order that sets are checked in might still matter
breaks sometimes when all subsets doesn't

## Lines :(
check every order of rows, columns, tlbr, bltr
keep best of all those
iterate on best and check all combos again until we get the same best twice in a row
pros:
both combos of rows/columns seems to be able to get best for boxes (only on grids)
very fast
cons:
doesn't do knights well
best is not guaranteed for boxes
only works well for NxM grids not pluses
order of checks matters so we have to check every order

## Spiral
for every space on the board
find best beacon there
find best beacon for adjacent spaces one at a time
iterate on best and repeat until we get the same best twice in a row
pros:
very fast to check one space at a time
cons:
completely untested
order/direction of spiral probably matters

## Small Groups
do overlapping 2x2 squares in spiral from center
pros:
fast
con:
might not be best hardly ever

## Random :(((
for every space on the board in a random order
find the best beacon there
keep track of best
repeat forever?
pros:
very fast to check one space at a time
cons:
completely untested
how many iterations til we can be confident in the result or just call it done?
wait how is this different from checking every space at once then?! less iterations?
